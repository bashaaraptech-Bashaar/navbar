      <h2>PEPSI</h2>
<p> <big><strong>Pepsi</strong></big> is a globally iconic carbonated soft drink created in 1893 by pharmacist Caleb Bradham. Originally marketed as "Brad's Drink," it was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898 for its digestive properties. As the flagship brand of PepsiCo, it is famous for its historic "Cola Wars" rivalry with Coca-Cola and its youth-centric marketing. In 2026, the brand continues to lead the beverage market with its bold new visual identity and an expanded focus on low-sugar options like Pepsi Zero Sugar.

<h2>The Refreshing Story of Pepsi</h2>
<h3>More than a drink — a global culture.</h3>
<p><big><strong>Pepsi</strong></big> <u>was invented in 1893 by North Carolina pharmacist Caleb Bradham </u>as "Brad’s Drink" before being renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898 to emphasize its digestive benefits. After surviving bankruptcies in the 1920s and 1930s, the brand surged during the Great Depression by offering 12-ounce bottles for just five cents—double the size of competitors for the same price. In 1965, a landmark merger with Frito-Lay created PepsiCo, setting the stage for decades of "Cola Wars" marked by high-profile celebrity ads and the famous Pepsi Challenge. In 2026, Pepsi continues to evolve its legacy with a focus on functional health through the launch of Pepsi Prebiotic Cola.</p>
